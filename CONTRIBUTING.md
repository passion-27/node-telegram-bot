If you are willing to contribute, first you should know I will love you and the Telegram Bot comunity too.

Other considerations:

- `README.md` is generated by the inline jsdoc with `npm run gen-doc`.
- Provide tests for your methods. For running tests you need to set some environment variables:
```bash
export TEST_TELEGRAM_TOKEN="123456:AAGoASDFJKnlj6uSQLIhjhBgOUY" # Your bot token
export TEST_USER_ID="66368736" # User wich the bot will send the messages (can be yours ID)
export TEST_GROUP_ID="-163889657" # A Telegram group which the bot have access
npm run test
```
- The code is transpilled with babel on Git Hook prepublish
- E=mcÂ²
